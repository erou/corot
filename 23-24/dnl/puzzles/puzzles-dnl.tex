This is a list of puzzles. You shall try to find a solution and explain your
reasonning to the class. It does not matter if your solution is incomplete or
incorrect, what is important though is that you are able to communicate/explain
your thinking to the class. Some puzzles are easier than others: harder puzzles
have more stars.

There are $5$ islands in a row. Parker the paranoid pirate has a ton of gold
hidden on one of them. During the day you have enough time to sail to just one
island to find the gold. But every night Parker moves all that gold exactly one
island over (so if it was on island $4$ it gets moved to either island $3$ or
