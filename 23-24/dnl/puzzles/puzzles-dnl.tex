This is a list of puzzles. You shall try to find a solution and explain your
reasonning to the class. It does not matter if your solution is incomplete or
incorrect, what is important though is that you are able to communicate/explain
your thinking to the class. Some puzzles are easier than others: harder puzzles
have more stars.

\noindent\\[-12mm]
\begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
When asked about her birthday, a woman said: ``The day before yesterday I was
only 25 and next year I will turn 28.'' This is true only one day in a year -

\section{Parker the paranoid pirate ($\star\star\star$)}
% Source: https://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-islands-solution.html
\noindent
\begin{minipage}{.7\textwidth}
There are $5$ islands in a row. Parker the paranoid pirate has a ton of gold
hidden on one of them. During the day you have enough time to sail to just one
island to find the gold. But every night Parker moves all that gold exactly one
island over (so if it was on island $4$ it gets moved to either island $3$ or
$5$).
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{.3\textwidth}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=.7]{islands.jpg}
  \end{center}
\end{minipage}

\begin{itemize}
  \item What strategy can you use to have the best chance of finding the gold?
  \item Is it possible to be sure of finding the gold?
\end{itemize}
\emph{You can try this puzzle with a friend, one of you can be Parker.}

\section{Twice the age ($\star\star$)}
\noindent Age problems were quite the fashion in antiquity. Here is an
example.\\[5mm]
``I have twice the age you had when I had the age you have.
When you`ll have the age I have, together we will have 63 years.
How old are we (individually)?''

\section{Chocolates ($\star$)}
\noindent There were $100$ chocolates in a box. The box was passed down along a row of
people. The first person took one chocolate. Each person down the row took more
chocolates than the person before, until the box was empty.
What is the largest number of people that could have been in the row?
